Hi, I am an Associate Professor in the department of Statistics at Hunan University. Prior to joining Hunan University in December 2017, I obtained my Ph.D. from Hong Kong Baptist University in 2017, under the supervision of Prof. Lixing Zhu. Before this, I was a math teacher in Huangshan University for about 7 years.
